      "Esophageal intubation was done with no difficulty with the second attempt.  In a semi-Fowler position\n",
      " the probe was passed to transthoracic views at about 40 to 42 cm.  Multiple pictures obtained.  Assessment of the peak velocity was done later.\n",
      "The probe was pulled to the mid esophageal level.  Different pictures including short-axis views of the aortic valve was done.  Extubation done with no problems and no blood on the probe.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION: \n",
      " The left atrium was mildly dilated.  No masses or thrombi were seen.  The left atrial appendage was free of thrombus.  Pulse wave interrogation showed peak velocities of 60 cm per second.\n",
      "The left ventricle was normal in size and contractility with mild LVH.  EF is normal and preserved.\n",
      "The right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size.\n",
      "Mitral valve showed no vegetations or prolapse.  There was mild-to-moderate regurgitation on color flow interrogation.  Aortic valve was well-seated mechanical valve\n",
      " bileaflet with acoustic shadowing beyond the valve noticed.  No perivalvular leak was noticed.  There was increased velocity across the valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec with calculated aortic valve area by continuity equation at 1.2 cm2 indicative of moderate aortic valve stenosis based on criteria for native heart valves.\n",
      "No AIC.\n",
      "Pulmonic valve was somewhat difficult to see because of acoustic shadowing from the aortic valve.  Overall showed no abnormalities.  The tricuspid valve was structurally normal.\n",
      "Interatrial septum appeared to be intact\n",
      " confirmed by color flow interrogation as well as agitated saline contrast study.\n",
      "The aorta and aortic arch were unremarkable.  No dissection.\n",
      "IMPRESSION:\n",
      "1.  Mildly dilated left atrium.\n",
      "2.  Mild-to-moderate regurgitation.\n",
      "3.  Well-seated mechanical aortic valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec and calculated valve area of 1.2 cm2 consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.  Reevaluation in two to three years with transthoracic echocardiogram will be recommended.\n",

      "TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  \n",
      "Calcium scoring and coronary artery CTA with cardiac function was performed on Siemens dual-source CT scanner with postprocessing on Vitrea workstation.  Patient received oral Metoprolol 100 milligrams.  100 ml Ultravist 370 was utilized as the contrast agent.  0.4 milligrams of nitroglycerin was given.\n",
      "Patient's calcium score 164\n",
      " volume 205; this places the patient between the 75th and 90th percentile for age.  There is at least moderate atherosclerotic plaque with mild coronary artery disease and significant narrowings possible.\n",
      "Cardiac wall motion was within normal limits.  Left ventricular ejection fraction calculated to be 82%.  End-diastolic volume 98 mL\n",
      " end-systolic volume calculated to be 18 mL.\n",
      "There is normal coronary artery origins.  There is codominance between the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery.  There is mild to moderate stenosis of the proximal LAD with mixed plaque.  Mild stenosis mid LAD with mixed plaque.  No stenosis.  Distal LAD with the distal vessel becoming diminutive in size.  Right coronary artery shows mild stenosis proximally and in the midportion due to calcified focal plaque.  Once again the distal vessel becomes diminutive in size.  Circumflex shows mild stenosis due to focal calcified plaque proximally.  No stenosis is seen involving the mid or distal circumflex.  The distal circumflex also becomes diminutive in size.  The left main shows small amount of focal calcified plaque without stenosis.  Myocardium\n",
      " pericardium and wall motion was unremarkable as seen.\n",
      "IMPRESSION:\n",
      "1.  Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with values as above.  There are areas of stenosis most pronounced in the LAD with mild to moderate change and mild stenosis involving the circumflex and right coronary artery.\n",
      "2.  Consider cardiology consult and further evaluation if clinically indicated.\n",
      "3.  Full report was sent to the PACS.  Report will be mailed to Dr. ABC.\n",
